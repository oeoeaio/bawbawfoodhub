        Veggies! With recent changes in demand and supply, it is difficult to guarantee what will be in the box next week. We try to give an indication of the box contents on our home page on the Bulletin Board. The monthly newsletter may give some indication of what is in season. You can signup to our newsletter on the

      %p  We source seasonal vegetables as locally as we possibly can which means that many are grown in Gippsland. At certain times of the year (esp. late winter, early spring) we do source some produce from further away.

      %p All produce is certified organic, except where it comes from some of our trusted smaller local growers, who grow in an ecologically sensitive way, but may not be certified.

      When and where can I collect my box? Can I have it delivered?
    .content#collection
      %p Boxes are available for collection from our venue at 156-158 Queen Street, Warragul, between 12 midday and 5pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays. You can pick up your box on Friday or Saturday, but you must make specific arrangements to do this by Thursday evening.

      %p We also offer delivery to a rage of locations in West Gippsland for a $10.00 fee, on Wednesdays. The current towns covered by deliveries are Warragul, Drouin, Yarragon, Trafalgar, Longwarry, Bunyip and Garfield.

      %p Simply select the delivery option on the signup page if you would like your box delivered. You can also arrange for casual delivery to these locations if you let us know by Sunday midday for the coming week.

      %p If you would like a deliver to locations that are further afield, please contact us as we can access a Gippsland wide courier for a slightly higher cost that may be suitable.

      %p We only pack boxes that are pre-ordered and we need some lead time to harvest produce and place orders with our other local growers. To receive a box on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, you will need to sign up before midday on Sunday.

  %li.accordion-navigation
    %a{:href => "#forgot"}
      I forgot to collect my box!
    .content#forgot
      %p Please get in touch with us as soon as possible, chances are we have been trying to call or text you. You can get a hold of Janette on 0498 043 433. If we have not heard from you by 5pm on Thursday, our policy is to donate some of the contents to Baw Baw Combined Churches food relief while it is still fresh.

      %p Unpacking your box will attract a $5 unpack fee when you next collect items at the Food Hub. We are a non-profit and cannot afford to cover the administrative cost associated with uncollected boxes. We hope you can understand our position.

  %li.accordion-navigation
    %a{:href => "#away"}
      I will be away for a week (or two), what should I do?
    .content#away
      %p Our preferred option is always that you please organise a friend or family member to collect your box when you are not able to. We understand that this is not always possible so we can accept requests to temporarily suspend your subscription up until the Sunday midday cut-off time.

      %p
        You can suspend your subscription for up to four consecutive boxes. You will be charged a one-off $3 suspension administration fee when you collect your next box at the end of the suspension. If you need to suspend your subscription, you must let us know via email

        Any boxes cancelled after this time may be charged a $5 unpack fee, except in the case of an unforeseeable emergency.

<p>{{ cms:file header, as: image, class: 'producer-header' }}</p><h3>Elderslie Organics</h3><p>The Wallace family are dairy farmers and free range egg producers at Elliinbank, south of Warragul. Their flocks of hens nest and sleep in caravans which follow the cows around the farm. The "girls" contribute to soil health and fertility and produce fantastic fresh eggs. The family are part of the Organic Dairy Farmers of Australia Co-op, whose milk goes into the making of the cheddar and parmesan cheeses and butter which we offer each week.<br><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.elderslieorganics.com.au/">http://www.elderslieorganics.com.au</a></p>

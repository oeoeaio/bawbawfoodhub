<p>{{ cms:file header, as: image, class: 'producer-header' }}</p><h3>Kingfisher Citrus</h3><p>The juicy, sweet oranges and tasty mandarines from Kingfisher Citrus are always a hit at the Hub and at Warragul Farmer's Market. Lynton Fisher drops off our orders on his way home to Rosedale from the family citrus grove between Swan Hill and Mildura. You can find Aimee at the Warragul Farmer's market, where she sells freshly squeezed orange juice as well as the best in-season fruit.

<h2>Our Producers</h2><p>We source a wide range of wonderful fresh produce from across West Gippsland and we're proud to support the truly outstanding farmers and beautiful farms where it is grown. Most of them are very experienced organic growers, who are dedicated stewards of their land, protecting soil health, biodiversity and water quality and maintaining high standards of animal welfare and crop production methods without the use of chemical inputs.</p>
<p>A major purpose of the Baw Baw Food Hub is to support and mentor a greater quantity and variety of these ecological farming systems in our region.

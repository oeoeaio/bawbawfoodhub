As very experienced and innovative organic growers, they have developed a model of sustainable food production. Compost processed on-farm continually contributes to healthy soil life and nutritious produce. Tomatoes, broccoli, asparagus, peas, beans, eggplant, capsicums, kale, cabbage, onions, sweet corn and pumpkins are some of the lines from Cafresco to be found in our vegetable boxes.</p>

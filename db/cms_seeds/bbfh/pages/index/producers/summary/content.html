<h2>Our Producers</h2>We source a wide range of wonderful fresh&nbsp;produce&nbsp;from across West Gippsland&nbsp;and we're proud to support&nbsp;the truly outstanding&nbsp;farmers and beautiful farms where it is grown. Most of them are very experienced&nbsp;organic growers, who are dedicated stewards of their land, protecting soil health,&nbsp;biodiversity and&nbsp;water quality and maintaining high standards of animal welfare and crop production methods without the use of chemical inputs.&nbsp;<br><br>A major purpose of the Baw Baw Food Hub is to support and mentor a greater quantity and variety of these ecological farming systems in our region.<br><br>{{ cms:partial:/cms/producers }}

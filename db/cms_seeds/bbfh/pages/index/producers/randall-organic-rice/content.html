<p>{{ cms:file header, as: image, class: 'producer-header' }}</p><h3>Randall Organic Rice<br></h3><p>Our organic rice is grown by the Randall family, at Murrami, near Leeton, in southern NSW. We are able to maintain a very reasonable price, by dealing directly with the Randall's and through a handy back-load from the Melbourne Farmer's Markets (thanks, Steve!). We stock Doongarra (Low G.I.), Koshihikari (brown and white), long grain, plus rice crackers and rice flours.</p><p><span></span></p>

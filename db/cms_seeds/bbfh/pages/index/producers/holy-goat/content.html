<p>{{ cms:file header, as: image, class: 'producer-header' }}</p><h3>Holy Goat</h3><p>The goats, the land and the workers at Sutton Grange Organic Farm are all valued and nurtured by a remarkable vision that encompasses sustainability, generosity and quality. Ann-Marie Monda and Carla Meurs cheese are driven by an exceptional commitment to environmental and animal health, innovation and perfection in cheesemaking. Their organic native grass pastures, revegetation projects, research into goat health and wellbeing, innovative training of young farmers and cheesemakers are as important as the production of outstanding cheeses. All 100 goats in the milking herd are known by name, and by their connections with the five generations of breeding that went before them.</p>

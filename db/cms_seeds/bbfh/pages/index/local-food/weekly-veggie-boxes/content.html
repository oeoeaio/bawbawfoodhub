<div><h3>Local +&nbsp;Organic Vegetable Boxes</h3><span>At the heart of our Food Hub is the&nbsp;<b>Baw Baw Fresh Organics</b>&nbsp;veggie box scheme. Each week, we source and pack the best local produce we can find, from our group&nbsp;of ecological farmers. The boxes offer fantastic convenience, variety, quality, value and outstanding freshness. For more on why we think local and organic are important, have a look at our <a href="https://bawbawfoodhub.org.au/about/our-principles-values" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">principals and values</a>.<br></span><br></div><h3>How it works<br></h3>Our subscribers sign up for a three-month season of vegetable boxes.

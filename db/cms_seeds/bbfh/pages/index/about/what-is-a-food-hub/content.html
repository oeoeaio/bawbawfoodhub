<span><h2>What is a food hub?</h2>While they take many forms, operate at all scales and have different objectives, food hubs generally aim to provide better ways for producers to reconnect with individuals and businesses in their local communities who are seeking local produce.<br><br>The roles that food hubs can provide range from simple aggregation of produce right through to large scale processing, logistics and marketing. Their focus can be anything from seasonality, freshness and localness, through to health, nutrition and food access, or more economic aims such as supporting farmers and providing employment opportunities.<br><span><br>The food hub model is just beginning to take itâ€™s first steps here in Australia, but it is a very well established concept that is widely used in many other parts of the world.<br></span><br></span>We hope that by experimenting with the food hub model we can help Baw Baw and the surrounding regions engage with the food that is grown here, allowing our local food economy to thrive and grow. <br>

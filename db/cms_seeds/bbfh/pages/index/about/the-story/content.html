<h2>The Story</h2>The Baw Baw Food Hub grew out of a little local vegetable box scheme originally started in 2013 by Baw Baw Organics, which represents two&nbsp;small organic farms in&nbsp;West Gippsland&nbsp;<span>growing a wide range of vegetables, fruit, berries and nuts. As organic producers selling at Farmerâ€™s Markets, we learned that there is great enthusiasm for fresh, healthy organic food. Working with other local organic farmers and a small group of volunteers, we are developing a model for increasing access to local food in our community, while also helping to generate and support interest among local farmers in producing for local markets.<br><br>We are keen to promote the value of local and organic&nbsp;food and of small to medium farms producing a diversity of fresh produce and are eager to help to develop a thriving local food economy in our region.<div><br></div></span>

<span><h3>A different business model</h3><div>The Food Hub model offers a new way of framing decisions, where the business is designed to work for the good of people rather&nbsp;than people working for the primary benefit of business. This subtle but important&nbsp;difference in the way priorities are set offers a model for a new economy where people and the environment share importance with respect to the sustainability of the business. Using this model, we are able to easily justify a focus on projects that offer benefits other than those which are purely economic in nature.<br></div><div><br></div></span>

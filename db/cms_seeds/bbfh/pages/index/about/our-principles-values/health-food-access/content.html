<h3>Health + Food Access</h3><p>Healthy communities depend on healthy diets, and a healthy diet depends on access to high quality fruits and vegetables and other fresh produce. We are very lucky in that the very best source of such produce is available from local farmers right here in West Gippsland. Unfortunately, the way the food system is structured can mean that is very difficult for us to access good food that is grown very near our homes.</p><p>We believe that providing access to locally grown fresh produce for <u>everyone</u> is a great platform for&nbsp;maintaining and improving our health, while also supporting our farmers. It means we need to lower the structural and economic barriers to food access, by working to source and deliver local food to local people in the most cost effective ways.</p>

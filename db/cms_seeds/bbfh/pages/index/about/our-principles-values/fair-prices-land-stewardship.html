<h3>Fair Prices + Land Stewardship</h3><span>On par with the production of food, we believe that a farmerâ€™s equal greatest responsibility is the stewardship of their land. The health of our soils, rivers and ecosystems depends in a large part on the role that farmers are willing to play in managing biodiversity, water resources and soil vitality.<br><br>As eaters, we are all implicated in the way that farmers treat their land. If we are not willing to offer a fair wage in recognition of the time and effort required to undertake the important work of stewardship, then we are all responsible for the consequences to the health of our landscapes.</span><br>

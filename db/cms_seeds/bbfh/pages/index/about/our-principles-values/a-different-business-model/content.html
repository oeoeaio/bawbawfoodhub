<h3>A different business model</h3><p>The Food Hub model offers a new way of framing decisions, where the business is designed to work for the good of people rather than people working for the primary benefit of business. This subtle but important difference in the way priorities are set offers a model for a new economy where people and the environment share importance with respect to the sustainability of the business. Using this model, we are able to easily justify a focus on projects that offer benefits other than those which are purely economic in nature.</p>

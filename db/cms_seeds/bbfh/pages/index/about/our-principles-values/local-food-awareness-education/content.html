<h3>Local Food Awareness + Education</h3>
<p>West Gippsland is home to some of the most fertile and productive soils in the country. With high rainfall and long (enough) summers, it's a great place to produce food. We like to think of the unbounded richness of our region as a great foundation for encouraging re-engagement with our food.</p>
<p>
Our aim is to promote an awareness of the ways that food is produced, the opportunities that exist for accessing local food, and in turn to engage our community with the benefits of local food, whether it be for our health, the climate or the local economy.
<p>

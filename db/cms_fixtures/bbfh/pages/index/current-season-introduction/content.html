<div><h2>Summer is here!</h2>The veggies are finally starting to be in plentiful supply again, and so we're very excited to announce that we are&nbsp;starting to pack our boxes of local, fresh vegetables on a weekly basis again!<br><br>We will&nbsp;pack boxes every Tuesday in&nbsp;December up until (and including) the 23rd. We will then take a short break through&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;and the new year, and will begin packing boxes again from the 13th of January, and every week after that.<br><br>As usual, the pickup will be at the&nbsp;<b>rear</b>&nbsp;of 34 Mason Street, Warragul, between 4pm and 6pm on Tuesdays. For more information about how the boxes work and what to expect, have a look at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://bawbaworganics.org.au/local-food/weekly-veggie-boxes">our overview</a>.<br><br>We pack boxes to order, and so we need some lead time to harvest produce and place orders with our other local growers. To receive a box on Tuesday, you will need to sign up&nbsp;<b>before midday on the previous Saturday</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>Subscriptions are open to everyone, so feel free so invite your friends and family member to sign up for a box.<br><br>See you at the pickup!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></div>

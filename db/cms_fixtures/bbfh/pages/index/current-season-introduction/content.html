<div><h2>Signup for Winter</h2>We're packing veggie boxes every week throughout winter, and we'd love&nbsp;for you&nbsp;to join us. You can expect lots of hearty winter produce, perfect for&nbsp;soups, curries and stews as well as plenty of fresh greens and salad vegetables.<br><br>Pickup will be at the&nbsp;<b>rear</b>&nbsp;of 34 Mason Street, Warragul, between 4pm and 6pm on Tuesdays. For more information about how the boxes work and what to expect, have a look at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://bawbawfoodhub.org.au/local-food/weekly-veggie-boxes">our overview</a>.<br><br>We pack boxes to order, and so we need some lead time to harvest produce and place orders with our other local growers. To receive a box on Tuesday, you will need to sign up&nbsp;<b>before midday on the previous Sunday</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>Subscriptions are open to everyone, so feel free so invite your friends and family members to sign up for a box.<br><br>If you aren't able to commit to collecting a&nbsp;box each week, feel free to order the&nbsp;"flexible" version of your desired box size&nbsp;from our online store as and when you want one. Please&nbsp;note however that these attract a $3.00 administration surcharge.<br><br>See you at the pickup!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></div>

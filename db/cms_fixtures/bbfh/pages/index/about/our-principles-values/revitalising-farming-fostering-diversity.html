<h3>Revitalising Farming + Fostering Diversity</h3><span>Increasingly, we will face some big challenges with regard to the production of food, its distribution, its impact on the environment and vulnerability to changing climatic conditions.<br><br>To overcome these challenges we need to embrace new ways of thinking about food production, the value we place on farming as a profession and the support that we provide farmers in continuously transforming their practices in adaptive, scientific and transparent ways. <br><br>We believe that the key to resilience in any system is diversity, and so the best thing we can do is to foster innovation by supporting farming communities to reconnect with one another and to share ideas, knowledge and skills.</span><br>

<div><h3>Local +&nbsp;Organic Vegetable Boxes</h3><span>At the heart of our Food Hub is the&nbsp;<b>Baw Baw Fresh Organics</b>&nbsp;veggie box scheme. Each week, we source and pack the best local produce we can find, from our group&nbsp;of ecological farmers. The boxes offer fantastic convenience, variety, quality, value and outstanding freshness.

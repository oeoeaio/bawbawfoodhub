<div>{{ cms:page_file:header:image }}</div><h3>Elderslie Organics</h3><div>The Wallace family are dairy farmers and free range egg producers at Elliinbank, south of Warragul. Their flocks of hens nest and sleep in caravans which&nbsp;follow the cows around the&nbsp;farm. The "girls"&nbsp;contribute to soil health and fertility and produce fantastic fresh eggs. The family are part of the Organic Dairy Farmers of Australia Co-op, whose milk goes into the making of the cheddar and parmesan cheeses and butter which we offer each week.<br><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.elderslieorganics.com.au/">http://www.elderslieorganics.com.au</a></div>
